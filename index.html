      <h3>Project 1 – NPC Pathfinder Program</h3>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> My NPC Pathfinder Program uses BFS to guide the Non-Playable Character from start to finsih whilst avoiding the obstacles in its path!</p>
      <p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> Python </p>
      <p><strong>My contribution:</strong><em>I</em>fully developed this program using the knowledge from the lectures.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> I had a really difficult time trying to figure out how the NPC can recognise and not walk through the obstacles. I solved this by adding a validation check before the NPC moves to a new cell. The BFS algorithm only allows movement to cells that are within the grid and not marked as obstacles. As a result, the NPC naturally avoids walls and rocks while searching for the shortest path..</p>

      <h3>Project 2 – PasswordGenerator</h3>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is my password generator I made in Java. I have not used these passwords, so do not try reverse engineer my account passwords!!!.</p>
      <p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> Java </p>
      <p><strong>My contribution:</strong> I fully developed this program for an assignment! I have a report on it aswell if anyone is curious!</p>
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> I had a silly difficulty when trying to generate the passwords, where I forgot to open it in the correct directory and it would not create the passwords.txt file. I overcame this challenge by actually opening it in the right directory.</p>

      <h3>What is BFS (Breadth-First-Search)? (short explanation)</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
      <p>
      BFS or Breadth-First-Search is a searching algorithm that explores every node in a given data structure.
      It selects a starting point and then from that node it explores its closest neighbours and after searching all of its closest neighbours, 
        it explores the neighbours of the nodes it has already visited. In the end it stores all of the nodes it has visited and removes it from the unvisited or the queue.

      <h3>Intro to normalisation in databases</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
      <p>
        Normalisation is the process of organising tables in a database so that 
        each table focuses on one topic and there is minimal duplicated data.
        This helps keep the data consistent and easier to maintain.
      </p>

    <p>
      I use this section to write short explanations of ideas from computer architecture,
      databases, and other modules, so I remember them and can show my understanding.

  <h3>What is an HTTP request?</h3>
  <p>
    When I type a website address into my browser and press Enter, my computer sends an HTTP request to a web server.
    This request is a structured message that asks the server for a specific resource, such as a web page or an image.
    The server receives the request, processes it, and then sends back an HTTP response.
    The response includes a status code, for example 200 OK if everything worked, and the content that should be displayed.
    My browser reads this response and shows the page on the screen.
    This request–response cycle happens many times when I visit a modern website, because the page often needs extra files like images, CSS, and JavaScript.

    <h2>What I am working on now</h2>
    <p>
      At the moment, I am continuing to develop my programming skills in both Python and Java. Recently in class, we have been learning about defensive programming and the different techniques that can be used to make programs more reliable and secure. 
      This includes implementing validation, error handling, and anticipating potential user mistakes to prevent the program from crashing.
      
      In Java, we are currently focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We are learning the importance of creating classes and objects, and how these concepts can be implemented to design more structured, reusable, and robust programs.
      Understanding OOP has helped me see how real-world problems can be modelled in code and has improved the overall organisation and efficiency of my programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I plan to specialise in the fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. 
      As technology continues to evolve, I am particularly interested in how secure systems can be designed to defend against emerging cyber threats, as well as how AI can be applied to enhance security, data analysis, and automation.

      To achieve this, I intend to keep improving my programming, problem-solving, and theoretical knowledge throughout my studies. 
      My long-term goal is to pursue a career in the technology sector where I can contribute to building secure, intelligent, and innovative systems that have real-world impact
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly interested in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, where I can work on developing secure systems and intelligent technologies. 
      I want to explore how AI can be used to enhance security and protect data from modern cyber threats.
      Red-Teamers and Machine Learning seem very cool to me! So im looking towards that direction.
