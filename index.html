        <h3>Project 1 – NPC Pathfinder Program</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> My NPC Pathfinder Program uses BFS to guide the Non-Playable Character from start to finish while avoiding obstacles in its path.</p>
        <p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> Python</p>
        <p><strong>My contribution:</strong> I fully developed this program using knowledge from lectures.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> I initially found it difficult to ensure the NPC could recognise obstacles and avoid walking through them.
          I solved this by adding a validation check before the NPC moves to a new cell. The BFS algorithm only allows movement to cells that are within the grid and not marked as obstacles.
          As a result, the NPC naturally avoids walls and rocks while searching for the shortest path.

        <h3>Project 2 – Password Generator</h3>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A Java password generator I built for an assignment.</p>
        <p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> Java</p>
        <p><strong>My contribution:</strong> I fully developed this program and wrote a report on it as well.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> I had an issue where the program wasn’t creating the <code>passwords.txt</code> file because I was using the wrong working directory.
          I fixed it by running the program from the correct directory.

        <h3>What is BFS (Breadth-First Search)?</h3>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
        <p>
          BFS (Breadth-First Search) is a searching algorithm that explores nodes level by level.
          It starts from a chosen node, visits its closest neighbours first, then explores the neighbours of those nodes.
          It typically uses a queue to track which node should be explored next.

        <h3>Intro to normalisation in databases</h3>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
        <p>
          Normalisation is the process of organising tables in a database so each table focuses on one topic and there is minimal duplicated data.
          This helps keep the data consistent and easier to maintain.

        <h3>What is an HTTP request?</h3>
        <p>
          When I type a website address into my browser and press Enter, my computer sends an HTTP request to a web server.
          This request asks the server for a specific resource, such as a web page or an image.
          The server then sends back an HTTP response with a status code (e.g., 200 OK) and the content to display.
          This request–response cycle happens many times on modern websites because pages often load extra files like images, CSS, and JavaScript.

        I use this section to write short explanations of ideas from computer architecture,
        databases, and other modules so I remember them and can show my understanding.

      <h2>What I am working on now</h2>

      <p>
        At the moment, I am continuing to develop my programming skills in both Python and Java.
        Recently in class, we have been learning about defensive programming and techniques that can be used to make programs more reliable and secure.
        This includes implementing validation, error handling, and anticipating potential user mistakes to prevent programs from crashing.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Java, we are currently focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
        We are learning the importance of creating classes and objects, and how these concepts can be implemented to design more structured, reusable, and robust programs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking ahead, I plan to specialise in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
        I am particularly interested in how secure systems can be designed to defend against emerging cyber threats,
        and how AI can be applied to enhance security, data analysis, and automation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am especially interested in areas like security testing (red teaming) and machine learning,
        and I want to explore how AI can be used to detect threats and strengthen system security.
