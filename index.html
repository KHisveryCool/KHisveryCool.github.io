      <h3>Project 1 – NPC Pathfinder Program</h3>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> My NPC Pathfinder Program uses BFS to guide the Non-Playable Character from start to finsih whilst avoiding the obstacles in its path!</p>
      <p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> Python </p>
      <p><strong>My contribution:</strong><em>I</em> I fully developed this program using the knowledge from the lectures.</p>
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> I had a really difficult time trying to figure out how the NPC can recognise and not walk through the obstacles. I solved this by adding a validation check before the NPC moves to a new cell. The BFS algorithm only allows movement to cells that are within the grid and not marked as obstacles. As a result, the NPC naturally avoids walls and rocks while searching for the shortest path..</p>

      <h3>Project 2 – PasswordGenerator</h3>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is my password generator I made in Java. I have not used these passwords, so do not try reverse engineer my account passwords!!!.</p>
      <p><strong>Tech stack:</strong> Java </p>
      <p><strong>My contribution:</strong> I fully developed this program for an assignment! I have a report on it aswell if anyone is curious!</p>
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> I had a silly difficulty when trying to generate the passwords, where I forgot to open it in the correct directory and it would not create the passwords.txt file. I overcame this challenge by actually opening it in the right directory.</p>
